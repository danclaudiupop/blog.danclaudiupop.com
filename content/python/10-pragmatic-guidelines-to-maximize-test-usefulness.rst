ABSTRACT
========

**WHAT MAKES GOOD TESTS?**

- Tests should be as simple as possible.
- Tests should run as quickly as possible.
- Tests should avoid coupling with other tests.
- Tests should communicate intent.

**CANONICAL FORM OF A TEST**

- Setup pre-conditions.
- Perform operation under test.
- Make assertions.
- Benefits of following canonical form.

**TESTING TOOLS**

- Factories (instead of fixtures).
- Coverage.py
- django-nose + multiprocess

**GUIDELINES**

- Tests should be as simple as possible.
- Each test method tests one thing, and one thing only.
- Only set up the minimum needed pre-conditions for your test.
- Create your pre-conditions explicitly - don't use shared helper methods outside your module.
- Name your TestCase methods to indicate what they actually test.
- Use factories, not fixtures.
- Use django.tests.TestCase instead of unittest2.TestCase
- Create mixins, not shared TestCases.
- Segment your tests.
- Don't use setupClass() or tearDownClass()
