            <p>There are many ways to test a software product. There are many methodologies
that could help in testing that software product, so that the final release
contains as less bugs as possible. We are not at the point where we could say
that we have found the solution for bug free applications. But we are at the
point where we know that in order to avoid buggy, hard to use, no precise scope
defined applications, we need an approach that will ensure a higher quality of
the product. One of these ways could very well be Exploratory Testing, done
right, done different.  Exploratory Testing is important.  Exploratory Testing
can be learnt.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these are some of the messages that can be heard when
reading Explore It!, by Elisabeth Hendrickson.</p>
<p>As Cem Kaner himself states, Exploratory Testing is a style of software
testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the
individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by
treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result
interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel
throughout the project.  That’s a pretty accurate definition. But what does
this mean exactly? How could I learn to be a more creative individual, when all
around me and my work requires 100% analytical thinking? Do I need to be more
creative, or to have a better sense of responsibility in order to execute
exploratory tests that actually find defects and weaknesses?</p>
<p>I’ve started looking for some of the answers I need through “Exploratory
Testing”. I have to say that I found the book incredibly easy to read and
captivating. The real-world examples were in the right places, and I could
better visualize the applicability of a concept presented in a specific
section. However, at some point, I felt that the examples became too detailed
and a more high-level explanation should have sufficed (but this is maybe a
singular opinion, I guess it depends on our own perception on exploratory
testing).  The personas concept is something I have never thought of and it’s
definitely something I would like to try with my team someday. The idea of role
playing of well-defined characters, in order to cover more classes of
vulnerabilities is one of the many out-of-the-box examples and concepts that
are defined in this book.</p>
<p>All in all, I sincerely recommend this book for any tester who would like
to better themselves. It is suitable not only for functional testers, but it
also has a few interesting approaches for the non-functional parts of the
system as well. It has great advices on how to perform a good interview and how
to do well on an interview, when faced with testing unfamiliar applications.</p>
<p>What I realized is that I found a few answers, but I have also discovered
new questions and for me, this is more important. It means that the book got me
thinking and questioning - how could I become a better explorer?</p>
